Bizarre:
It seems that the Bizarre compiler optimizes
the order of operations from right to left, it uses the knowledge
of addition and mulipication are assosiative,
So the internal order of operations doesn't matter.
While still keeping the operator precedence between addition and multipication.
See from the perspective of binary trees, it generates a righthand tree, where each left child is always a leaf.

examples: (+ 1 (+ (+ 2 3) (+ 4 (+ (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))))) -->
 	  (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 (+ 5 (+ 6 (+ 7 8)))))))

	  (* 1 (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8))))-->
	  (* 1 (+ (* 2 3) (+ (* 4 5) (* 6 (+ 7 8)))))

	  (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) 8) -->
	  (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 (+ 5 (+ 6 (+ 7 8))))))) 

Strange:
It seems that the Strange compiler optimizes
the order of operations from left to right. Which is symetric to Bizarres optimization

examples: (+ 1 (+ (+ 2 3) (+ 4 (+ (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))))) -->
 	  (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) 8)

	  (* 1 (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8)))) -->
	  (* 1 (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8))))

	  (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 (+ 5 (+ 6 (+ 7 8))))))) -->
	  (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) 8)

Surprising:
It seems that the Surprising compiler doesn't optimize
the order of operations, but rather optimizes addition and multipication,
whenever there's 1 and 0's in the expression.
In other words, it optimizes the identity element and the property of zero
for addition and multipication.

examples: (+ 1 (+ (+ 2 3) (+ 4 (+ (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))))) -->
	  (+ 1 (+ (+ 2 3) (+ 4 (+ (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))))) -->

	  (* 1 (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8)))) -->
	  (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8)))

	  (+ (+ 0 (* 1 2)) (+ 3 4)) --> (+ 2 (+ 3 4))

	  (* 0 (+ 0 (+ (* 1 2) (+ 3 4)))) --> 0
