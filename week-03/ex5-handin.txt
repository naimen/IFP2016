Bizzare:
It's seems that the Bizzare compiler optimizes the order of operations,
it uses the knowledge of addition and mulipication are assosiative, so the
internal order of operations doesn't matter. While still keeping the operator
precedence between addition and multipication.

examples: (+ 1 (+ (+ 2 3) (+ 4 (+ (+ 5 6) (+ 7 8))))) -->
 	  (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 (+ 5 (+ 6 (+ 7 8)))))))

	  (* 1 (+ (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)) (* 6 (+ 7 8))))-->
	  (* 1 (+ (* 2 3) (+ (* 4 5) (* 6 (+ 7 8)))))
