====== exercise 1 =======
Assuming an underlying interpreter that is call by value, does the meta-circular interpreter evaluate sub-expressions, in an application, from left to right or from right to left?

The meta-circular interpreter evaluates sub-expressions from left to right, as the interpreter evaluates though the first part of the argument, afterwards it evaluates though the second part of the argument, as the nature of call by value, the value of the first evaluation of the arguments are passer thoughout the whole procedure.
=====================

====== exercise 2 =======
What do you make of Brynja¡¯s question, at the end of the section about call by name, piled on?

The tower of interpreter is slow, and salute to Olivie, who used 3 days to prove a point.
When look at the efficiency, we took the overall time and divide it with sum of time from both sets, and the result became ~100 for 0 height, ~74 for 1 height and ~70 for 2 height. So the efficiency was getting better the more height we get which is very interesting as the running of multipel height escalates tremendously.
